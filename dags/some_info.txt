- API for getting members of organizations seems doesn't work correctly, since returns very low members
- Some commits do not have a commiter (commiter: None), which seems odd 
- We have a request_reviewer field in the PR, which represents a reviewer who has not yet reviewed the PR. Once the requested reviewer submits their review, they are no longer considered a requested reviewer
